<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to replace the Demander une démo button with a Login button and create a comprehensive admin page. This admin panel should function like a CMS (e.g., WordPress), allowing the user to easily manage and update ALL content and photos for every page on the site. The user explicitly requested a system where changes made in the admin panel are immediately reflected on the public-facing website. This evolved from an initial simple request into a full-blown CMS implementation.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **Admin Authentication**: A secure login page for an admin user.
2.  **CMS-style Dashboard**: A central admin dashboard to manage all website content.
3.  **Content Management**: The ability to edit all text content for every page (Home, Pricing, About, Contact, legal pages, etc.).
4.  **Image Management**: The ability to upload, change, and preview all images on the site, including hero carousel slides, product images, and pricing plan images.
5.  **Dynamic Frontend**: The public-facing website must dynamically fetch and display the content stored in the database, ensuring that any changes made in the admin panel are visible on the live site.
6.  **Full Site Coverage**: The CMS must control the content of the entire website, not just a few pages.

**User's preferred language**: French

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack CMS application has been built with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The backend has dozens of API endpoints for managing content, products, users, pricing, etc., and the data is stored in MongoDB. The frontend features a comprehensive admin dashboard with ~14 sections for managing all aspects of the site.

Throughout this session, the agent has:
- Populated the MongoDB database with demo data for all content types (products, blog posts, team members, page content, etc.).
- Fixed numerous bugs reported by the user, including React hook violations, incorrect API response keys, and data rendering errors.
- Significantly improved the UI/UX of the admin panel based on user feedback, ensuring all managers now display a list of existing content while editing.
- Refined the public-facing  page with a new, colorful, and centered design.
- Added the capability to edit multiple gallery images for product-like pages within the admin.
- Fixed a critical bug where uploaded images were not being saved automatically.

However, the agent has just discovered the root cause of the user's persistent frustration: the public-facing pages are still rendering **hardcoded content** from within their  files, while the admin panel is reading/writing to the database, which contains different (demo) data. The core connection and data synchronization is the final missing piece.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent had a critical realization after the user pointed out that the images and text in the admin panel did not match what was on the live site. The agent investigated and confirmed that pages like  are still displaying hardcoded content, not data from the CMS database. The agent's last action was to diagnose this fundamental mismatch and conclude that the immediate next step is to extract the *actual, hardcoded content* from the website's source code and use it to populate the database.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N/A (This was a diagnostic step)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. After the data synchronization task is complete, the agent must test that: 1. Visiting a public page (e.g., /restaurant-pos) displays the correct content. 2. The user can log into the admin panel, change that content, save it, and see the change reflected on the public page after a refresh.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: (P0) Public site content does not match admin panel content.
-   Issue 2: (P1) Ensure 100% of site content is editable.

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1:**
    -   **Description:** This is the absolute highest priority. The user has repeatedly stated that what they see in the admin panel is not what is on the live site. The agent has now correctly identified that the public pages are rendering hardcoded data, while the admin panel is connected to a database with different, generic demo data.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent has connected the pages to the API, but this is ineffective as long as the database does not contain the correct source-of-truth data.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Systematically go through each key public page (starting with , , etc.) and the  file.
        2.  Extract all hardcoded text, feature lists, product details, and image URLs.
        3.  Write a script or use MongoDB commands to **update** the existing database entries (or create new ones) with this *actual* content.
        4.  Verify on the live site that the page now displays the same content that is visible in the admin panel.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will finally fulfill the user's core requirement for the entire project. It will synchronize the admin panel and the public website, making the CMS useful and allowing the user to manage their site's content as intended.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
-   **Issue 2:**
    -   **Description:** The user wants to edit *every* photo and piece of text. While many fields have been added, a final audit is required to ensure no content is left behind.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent added support for multiple gallery images and created admin tabs for 12+ sub-pages.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** While performing the data extraction for Issue 1, the agent should identify any text or images that do not have a corresponding field in the database schema and add them.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will complete the user's full CMS request.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.

**In progress Task List**:
-   Task 1: (P0) Synchronize CMS Database with Hardcoded Website Content.

**Task Detail:**
-   **Task 1:**
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent has identified the problem. The next step is to begin extracting the hardcoded data from  and other relevant  and  files, and then writing it to the  MongoDB database.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The admin panel will finally reflect the true content of the live website, allowing the user to edit it.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.
    -   **Blocked on something:** No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   (P1) After the content is synchronized and verified, connect the remaining ~30+ pages to the CMS.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   (P2) Refactor  by renaming it to  and deleting the old file to reduce confusion.
    -   (P3) Complete the blog section by creating the remaining individual blog post pages ( to ).

**Completed work in this session**
-   **CMS Core Functionality Fixed:**
    -   Fixed homepage carousel functionality and connected it to the admin panel.
    -   Populated the database with extensive demo data for all sections.
    -   Fixed a critical bug where uploaded images were not saved automatically.
    -   Enabled editing of multiple gallery images for product pages.
-   **Admin Panel UI/UX Overhaul:**
    -   Redesigned all admin managers (Products, Pricing, Blog, etc.) to always display a list of existing content, preventing the blank page issue during creation/editing.
    -   Redesigned the editing experience in most managers to use a smaller, more user-friendly modal popup.
    -   Added dozens of new editable fields and tabs in the Contenu Pages section to cover more of the site's content.
-   **Public-Facing Site Improvements & Fixes:**
    -   Completely redesigned the  page with a modern, colorful, and centered layout.
    -   Fixed numerous critical bugs on public pages (, , ) that were causing crashes.
    -   Reduced the size of the callback popup.
    -   Fixed broken navigation links in the main navbar.
    -   Removed an unwanted icon from the footer logo.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, MongoDB (), JWT for auth.
-   **Frontend**: React, React Router, Context API, Axios, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Architecture**: Decoupled frontend/backend. The core issue is the data divergence between the frontend's hardcoded content and the backend's database.

**key DB schema**
-   Collections are defined implicitly by Pydantic models. Key collections include , , , , , , .
-   The  collection schema has been expanded to support multiple image fields (e.g., , , etc.).

**All files of reference**
-   : This entire directory is critical. The next agent needs to read from these files to extract hardcoded content. Pay special attention to , , and .
-   : A source of hardcoded data that needs to be migrated to the database.
-   : The entry point for all API routes.
-   : The main component for page content editing.
-   : Contains the database name () which is crucial for connection.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **The single most important task is to resolve the data discrepancy.** The user is frustrated because the admin panel and the live site are out of sync. Your first priority must be to extract the hardcoded content from the  files and  and use it to populate the MongoDB .
-   Do not create *more* demo data. Use the *actual* content from the site's code as the source of truth.
-   The user has been very specific about their requests and frustrated by misunderstandings. Read user requests very carefully. For example, when they asked to beautify the pricing page, the previous agent modified the Restaurant POS page by mistake, which had to be reverted.
-   After synchronizing the data for a page, immediately test the full loop: view the public page, edit in admin, save, and confirm the change appears on the public page.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User**: Reported an error in the FAQ admin ( undefined) and that he can't edit multiple photos for products. (Status: **Completed**, agent fixed the bug and added multi-image support).
2.  **User**: Reported that uploading an image doesn't save it. (Status: **Completed**, agent added an auto-save mechanism after upload).
3.  **User**: Reported the fundamental problem: the images/text in the admin are not the same as on the live site. (Status: **In Progress**, agent has diagnosed the root cause - hardcoded data).
4.  **User**: (Implicit in #3) wants the *real* site content to be editable in the admin. (Status: **Pending**, this is the main upcoming task).
5.  **User**: Provided a screenshot of the calculator icon next to the footer logo and asked for its removal. (Status: **Completed**).
6.  **User**: Reported the callback popup is too big and two navigation links don't work. (Status: **Completed**).
7.  **User**: Reported errors on the pricing page and an error related to . (Status: **Completed**).
8.  **User**: Asked to add colors and centering to the pricing page. Also reiterated the need for the admin to control *all* live site content. (Status: **Completed**, pricing page was beautified).
9.  **User**: Pointed out that the agent beautified the wrong page ( instead of ) and added unwanted colors to the admin panel. (Status: **Completed**, agent reverted the incorrect changes).
10. **User**: After the pricing page was beautified, asked for a descriptive header to be added. (Status: **Completed**).

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:**
    -   The data synchronization between the live site and the admin CMS. Public pages display hardcoded content, while the admin edits a separate dataset in the database.

**3rd Party Integrations**:
-   None.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES. The testing agent was used multiple times to verify bug fixes and feature implementations.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO.
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** A major regression occurred when the agent modified  by mistake; this was reverted using usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The previous agent repeatedly forgot/misunderstood the user's core request: the public site must display the data from the admin panel. This led to building out a CMS and populating it with generic demo data, which does not match the hardcoded content the user actually sees on their site. This fundamental disconnect is the primary task left to solve.</analysis>
